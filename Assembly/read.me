These are some Assembly programs that I worked on around 2003-2005.

They were mostly written on and for an HP-200lx palmtop pc

they can be compiled with Bert Greevenbosch's Magic Assembler:

BOWL.ASM  - written to add up scores at the end of a night of bowling.
CRC16.ASM - aided with some CRC work while implementing modbus in C.
LCD.ASM   - fiddling with drawing lines, also LCD4.ASM and LINE.ASM.
